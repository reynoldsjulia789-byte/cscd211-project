## CSCD 211 Project
This project was created by following a tutorial given to me by my 210 professor to create
a project that helped me reinforce the concepts for CSCD 211 (Programming Principles II)
in preparation to test out of the course.

## Plans
- continue to update the UI for this project as I am currently unhappy with how it looks
- figure out why "WARNING: Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @33108e58'" occurs when running
